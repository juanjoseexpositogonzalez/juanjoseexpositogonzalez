Your engineers shouldn't waste hours searching through manuals. I turn technical documentation into AI assistants that actually understand your domain.

🎯 What Makes Me Different:
22 years as a Drilling Engineer (Repsol, ADNOC, Moeve) + PhD in Engineering + hands-on AI development. I don't just build AI systems—I understand the operational reality they need to serve. When your technical docs are 500-page PDFs that nobody can find, I build RAG systems that deliver instant, accurate answers.

📊 Recent Impact:

Built RAG systems processing 200+ technical documents with contextual accuracy
Developed AI classification agents for automated expense categorization
Created workflow automation tools solving real operational problems
Delivered production-ready AI assistant in 6-week mentorship sprint

⭐ Client Testimonial:
"I learned the intricacies of developing RAG systems in 6 weeks that would have otherwise taken 6 months - 1 year on my own. Juanjo's deep knowledge of Python development, AI applications, and infrastructure were mind blowing. The proof is in the deliverable: a working AI application in 6 weeks. You should work with Juanjo."
— Tim Gallati, Founder @ Quiet Links Library
🛠 Technical Stack:

- LLM & RAG: LangChain, LangGraph, OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, Weaviate, Pinecone
- MCP Servers and security
- Backend: Python, FastAPI, PostgreSQL
- Automation: n8n, Make
- Credentials: PhD in Engineering, PyBites Certified Python Developer

🤝 Let's Build Something Real
I specialize in RAG systems for technical documentation in energy, industrial, and engineering sectors. If your teams waste hours digging through manuals instead of doing their actual work—I solve that problem.

Not interested in: AI hype, buzzword projects, or solutions looking for problems.
Interested in: Practical implementations that deliver measurable results—reduced search time, fewer errors, faster onboarding.
Currently taking on select clients for:

- Technical documentation → AI assistant transformation
- Custom RAG implementation & optimization
- Knowledge base automation for engineering teams

I speak your language. Let's discuss how to turn your documentation chaos into a competitive advantage.
